## Submission Instructions

### Overview
How many times have you stopped at the grocery store on your way home from work and couldn't remember if you needed milk? Maybe you remember seeing a half gallon this morning, but when will it expire?  How many times have you put something in the freezer only to find it months later buried underneath much fresher foods? My project will help you with these common problems.  It will help you keep track of your groceries and their expiration dates.  This web app will serve as a way to get organized and eliminate food waste.  It will begin as a way to inventory your groceries.  You can enter your groceries as you buy them, or when you get home.  It will also have a place to keep track of expiration dates of inventory.  As it grows, it will be capable of automatically generating a shopping list based on expiration dates.  It will also be capable of scanning grocery barcodes (through API).  Another possible feature would be to send a text or email reminder when one of your items nears its expiration date.  

### Features
**Register/Login** - Create a login to access your inventory from anywhere.
**Add/Remove inventory** - Add groceries as you buy them.  Remove groceries when they are eaten.
**Sort inventory by location** stored (refrigerator, freezer or pantry)

**Send alerts and/or reminders** when a grocery item has expired or is about to expire
